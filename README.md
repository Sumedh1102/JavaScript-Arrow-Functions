# ðŸš€ JavaScript Arrow Functions   

This repository contains examples of JavaScript **arrow functions**, demonstrating their usage with **map, filter, and reduce** methods for arrays. Arrow functions provide a concise way to write function expressions, making your code **cleaner and more readable**.  

## ðŸ“Œ Features  
âœ… Understanding arrow functions syntax  
âœ… Using `map()` for transformation  
âœ… Filtering elements with `filter()`  
âœ… Summing values with `reduce()`  

## ðŸ“– Explanation  
- `map()` is used to **transform** each element in an array.  
- `filter()` helps in **extracting specific elements** based on conditions.  
- `reduce()` is used to **accumulate values** in an array.  

## ðŸš€ How to Use  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sumedh1102/JavaScript-Arrow-Functions.git
   ```  
2. Open `index.js` in a code editor.  
3. Run the script using:  
   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```  
4. Check the output in the console.  

## ðŸ“Œ Why Use Arrow Functions?  
âœ” Shorter and cleaner syntax  
âœ” No need for explicit `return` in single expressions  
âœ” Inherits `this` from the surrounding scope
